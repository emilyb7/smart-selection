## For developers

This app relies on a single script which lives in Google Drive.

Although there are multiple script files in this repo, all files are compiled into a single `Code.gs` file when the app is updated.

The files can also be viewed / edited on Google Drive. However, your local version should be your master version as the online version will be overwritten if you push updates.
